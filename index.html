      <h1> My First Ever HTML Project </h1>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;"> Hello Dearest Wanderer, <br>
           <style= "colour: #ff0000;"> Welcome to my page! This is the first time I am ever coding in HTML so I apologize in advance for any bugs. ** <br>
               <br></br>
            My name is Sansita Malhotra and I am 15 years of age, turning 16 come June. I am a student studying at RH King Academy and currently in my second year of highschool, Grade 10.<br>
            As I enter this 'make it or break it' period of my life, I am weighing my future career options and the field I want to pursue. As of right now, I am toggling between Computer Engineering and the Medical Field. I am hoping by undertaking this project, I am able to make a more informed decision. <br>
