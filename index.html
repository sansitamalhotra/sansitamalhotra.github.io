        <p> Hello Dearest Wanderer, <br>
           Welcome to my page! This is the first time I am ever coding utilizing the HTML language so I apologize in advance for any bugs. <br>
           My name is Sansita Malhotra and I am 15 years of age, turning 16 come June. I am a student studying at RH King Academy and currently in my second year of highschool, Grade 10.<br>
           As I enter this 'make it or break it' period of my life, I am weighing my future career options and the field I want to pursue. <br>
           As of right now, I am toggling between Computer Engineering and the Medical Field. I am hoping by undertaking this project, I am able to make a more informed decision. <br>
           I understand the vale of hardwork and a job well done so I am always striving to thrive in whatever it is I chose to do. When I am not occupied with my school commitments, <br>
           you can find me with my nose buried in a book or laughing with my friends.
